CS 360 Project


Idea: Exhibit tons of web technologies
Motivation: Learning to code by example is nice! There are examples, but not a comprehensive set all together. Helpful to get exposed to a lot of different technologies.
App: Users can add examples for different pieces of the HTML/CSS (maybe JS) spec. For instance, add an example for every possible option for “background-image” CSS attribute. Pages will include code and the live example side-by-side.
Team: Chris Anderson, Derrick Craven
